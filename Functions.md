A function is a thing that transforms one number into another. You can graph functions based on their in and output.
A function is most often written as a formula like this: 
$$f(x) = x^2 + 1$$
pronounced as "f of x equals x squared plus one"
## Domain and co-domain of a function
We call the [[Sets|set]] of values a function takes as input the domain of the function and the we call the possible output values the co-domain of the function. We can also illustrate this using some arrows.
